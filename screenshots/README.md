# aws-site-to-site-vpn
Build and configure a secure Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between AWS and a Cisco IOSv router inside Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world site-to-site VPN connection between an on-prem router (CML) and AWS. It demonstrates how hybrid networks can securely connect using IPsec tunnels and shared routing.

## Purpose
To showcase hands-on AWS networking skills in a hybrid cloud scenario relevant for Senior Network Engineer roles involving AWS-native infrastructure and cloud automation.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS** (VPC, Customer Gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, VPN Connections, Route Tables)
- **Cisco IOSv** (running in Cisco Modeling Labs)
- **Site-to-Site VPN** (IPsec with IKEv2)
- **Git & GitHub** (project versioning and portfolio)
- **Wireshark** (optional: packet inspection)
- **Ansible** (optional: automation of router configuration)
