## 🔧 Project Summary

This project simulates a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between an AWS VPC and an on-premises environment. For lab purposes, the on-prem router was emulated using an Ubuntu EC2 instance with StrongSwan installed, allowing us to test VPN tunnel configuration end-to-end using cloud-only resources.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn
- How to configure VPCs, route tables, and gateways in AWS
- How to simulate an on-prem router using StrongSwan on EC2
- How to build and troubleshoot IPsec VPN tunnels
- How to document and present network automation and cloud labs on GitHub

## 🔨 Tools Used
- AWS VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway
- EC2 (Ubuntu)
